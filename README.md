# How to use the script!!!!
To run this script you need to be in another directory than the home directory becuase this is an 
read only home directory
Make sure you changed the directory to /mnt/data
Use this command to change to mnt/data
```
cd /mnt/data
```

To run the installation process on your Sensecap M1 Gateway just use the following command
```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WantClue/Sensecap/main/install.sh
```
```
chmod +x install.sh
```
```
./install.sh
```
